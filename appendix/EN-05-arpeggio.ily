      An arpeggio (Italian: [arˈpeddʒo]) is a type of broken chord, 
      in which the notes that compose a chord are played or sung 
      in a rising or descending order. 
      An arpeggio may also span more than one octave.
      The word arpeggio comes from the Italian word arpeggiare, 
      which means to play on a harp.
